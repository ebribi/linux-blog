My name's Emersen, and I'm currently a senior Computer Science student at Brooklyn College in NYC. The first time I went to college I was a history and english major, so it's kind of shocking that I've ended up here.

I'm no expert at any of this stuff yet, but I'm trying my best! You can read more about my journey in [my first post](../posts/thejourneybegins/).
